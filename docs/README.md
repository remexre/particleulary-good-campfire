# CSCI 5611: Final Project

## Group

* Alexandra Hanson (hans7203)
* Nathan Ringo ()

## TO DO:

The report should:
* Demonstrate the final state of your project
* Discuss the key algorithms and approaches you used. What were the computational bottlenecks
to your approach? What would be the limiting factor to scaling up 10x or 100x bigger than what
you turned in?
* Address any of the specific questions outlined above for the project you choose
* Summarize the feedback you got from your peers during the progress report and discussed in
what ways (if any) you addressed this feedback for the final version.
* Highlight the relationship between your work (or the methods used by the tools you employed)
and the state-of-the-art both seen in the papers you saw in your related work search and
discussed elsewhere in class.
* Suggest some directions the project could be extended in the future. What are the limitations of
your current versions and how might you get pass them if given more time?

This report or webpage should be written in complete sentences (e.g., no bullet points).
Additionally, the report should be well structured (e.g., section headers), and should make use of
figures, images, and videos to help convey the key ideas.

Since we chose to do option 4 (i.e. implementing an animation technique we didn't)
implement in class, we also need to:

* Explicitly discuss the connection between your topic and topics from the course
* For one of the aspects of your demo, discuss what the related state-of-the-art techniques are
and discuss how the methods used by your code or tools related to the state-of-the-art.
