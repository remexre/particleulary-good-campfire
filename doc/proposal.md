## PROJECT PROPOSAL

**Title:** A particle-ulary good campfire

**Group Members:** Alexandra Hanson & Nathan Ringo

**Description:** We will try to create a pretty campfire simulation in a forest using 
the particle system technique. We'll use particles to represent fire and smoke and 
render these with some transparency so that the fire and smoke look convincing. We'll 
also use appropriate lighting for the scene to improve realism.Â
